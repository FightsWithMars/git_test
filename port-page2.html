                <p>I received his e-mail responses and, two days later, hit nine out of 10 free throws for the first time in
                    my life. Then, on Christmas Eve, I went bowling and realized that many of the same principles applied.
                    I scored 124, my first time over 100 and an Everest above my usual 50–70.
                    13 Upon returning home, I
                    immediately went outside and sunk the first two 3-pointers of my life. For Lakers games with the Roses,
                    I now see a ballet of kinesthetic beauty that was invisible before. That’s a hell of a lot of fun.</p>

                <p>How would you like to light a fire perfectly and have it burn for 3–7 hours without adding more wood?
                    It requires forgetting everything you’ve learned about starting fires.
                    Now, I can make a raging furnace of epic proportions, a crackling and screaming banshee of lifegiving heat…but it lasts for a euphoric five minutes. Then the real fun begins: the fiddling and fussing,
                    poking and prodding every five minutes thereafter for the next hour to keep the charred remains
                    clinging to life.</p>

                <p>I was in the Boy Scouts and learned the ropes: tons of paper and tinder at the bottom, building
                    upward like a tepee with the smallest kindling at the bottom and the biggest logs at the top. It’s how
                    fires are built, right?
                    Let’s call this the “tepee” fire.
                    The alternative is the “upside-down” fire</p>

            <p>Cardinal Giuseppe Mezzofanti, born 1774, was called “the Devil” on many occasions.
                The charming Italian could speak at least 39 languages and, by some accounts, had been tested in 72.
                As arguably the world’s most famous hyperpolyglot, he was also systematic.</p>
            <p>Second, and related to deconstruction: instead of using grammar books, he had native speakers of
                each language recite the Lord’s Prayer. This short passage gave him an overview of nearly all important
                grammatical structures (direct object, indirect object, noun cases, possessives, etc.):</p>
